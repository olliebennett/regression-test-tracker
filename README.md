# Regression Test Tracker

A Regression Test Tracking Application written in [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/).

This simple app helps you track the progress of a [regression test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing).

Note: This code __DOES NOT__ perform the testing for you.

## Features

### 1. Implemented Features

- none :(

### 2. Planned Features

- Easily add new tests during a regression run.

- Random or manual assignment of tasks.

- Rotate testers between test areas, to minimise chance of user error.

- Comment on tests

- Real-time progress status pie-chart.

- Fully define how testing happens;
	- number of testers
	- frequency of re-testing

- Assign an individual to supervise each group of tests

- No sign-up needed. Enter a list of email addresses, and everyone gets a unique access link.

### 3. Imagined Features

- Associate test areas together, so testing only happens on items which could have been affected by a change.

## Contact

Please be nice - this is my first attempt at a Node.js application. If there's anything I can improve on (and I'm sure there is), I'd love to hear about it!

If there's a feature you'd like to see, let me know!
